* Purpose
  Quickly-hacked together mesh viewer that displays labels for
  vertices and faces. Intended as a visual aid for developing mesh
  modeling tools.

* Usage
  Run the program. Copy a JSON representation of the mesh to the
  clipboard. MMB to load mesh. RMB-drag to rotate.

* Dependencies
  Uses xclip to read the clipboard (not cross-platform.)

* Status
  As of October 2nd, this has just had a few hours worth of
  development, so it's pretty useless.
